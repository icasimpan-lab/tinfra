putty ideas:

CTRL+Space 
    gives "popup with list of completions, ala Scite"

Alt+RClick 
    gives list of actions connected with current keyword
    
    
How to:

detect RClick:
    windows/window.c:2306  - grep case WM_LBUTTONDOWN:
        
    
    
copy all from term 
    term_copyall(term);
    (that might be starter for analyzing term contents
        
paste to term:
    request_paste(NULL);
    (that probably pasted clip)
    
    void term_do_paste(Terminal *term)
    uses get_clip() which should fill it's parameters with command buffer
