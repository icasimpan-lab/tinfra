process control design
    process_controller()
    
    user use case:
        query process state
            echo "lock" > /var/run/xagent/xagentctl
            tinfra-process-ctl DESC lock 
            tinfra-process-ctl DESC wait webmonitor.running=true
                awfull
            service --tinfra-process-ctl=unix:/var/run/service/ctl &
            tinfra-process-ctl unix:/var/run/service/ctl wait-initialized
                wait_initialized will register as event listener
                and for each event will check process-state if it's
                initialized and if yes, will return ok
            
        request process to "do something"
            reread config
            stop
            lock/unlock etc...
            activate/deactivate
