suppose that messages are 

    plain bytes at transport level
    
processes could be implemented using different
transports
    tcp         - tcp/ip socket
    pipe        - unnamed pipe
    ssl         - SSL over TCP/ip
    unix        - unix pipe
    fifo        - named pipe/fifo
    udp         - UDP socket
    shared_memory - shared memory (see boost interprocess)
    ...
    
    
components exchange messages aka
    protocol buffers/YAMI/etc
