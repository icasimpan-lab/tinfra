    on any machine under some circumstances we generate
    events that are of interest of desktop users
     tool error

        line

    this component is "client" it doesn't run inside container
    
    
    some component receives all those messages and
        tags with date
        tags with ??
        stores into db
        
        broadcast to interested components basing on filters
        
        this component has no state!

        this component lives in container
        
    on desktop one component
        registers for all events
